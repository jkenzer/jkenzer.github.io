## Jekyll Fun

I'm trying to use Jekyll to turn Github Pages into a blog. I'd like for sub-directories of this repository to auto show as links on the home page, but maybe the easiest way is to create a blog post that links to the sub-directory? That means creating the sketch page, then posting a blog post to link to it. Seems redundant.
