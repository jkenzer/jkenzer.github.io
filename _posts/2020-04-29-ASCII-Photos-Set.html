<h1>Playing Around with a array functions in Javascript</h1>
<p>This is a variation on <a href="https://jkenzer.github.io/sketchbook/sketch/2019/09/28/ASCII-Photos.html">Ascii Photos</a>. I'm using the same photo set, but instead of posterizing
    and then making it Ascii, I'm taking each unique char of the ascii set and removing it - a new one each frame.</p>
