I've seen this processing sketch a few times and always thought it looked pretty cool. I followed the [excellent tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-9jCNhLe-Q) from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) on YouTube.

I played with a few things to make sure I better understand how it works. One thing I added was a count of active connections and actually change the particle size based on the number of active connections.
