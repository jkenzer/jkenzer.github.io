I can't take credit for this one in anyway. On the [/r/Processing Sub reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/processing/) is an awesome programming artist, [jhorio](https://www.reddit.com/user/jhorio/). His work, I assume it's a "he" based off [his openprocessing.org](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/12128) avatar, is always awe inspring. I took this code from [his sketch](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/890082) and tried to understand it and modify it.

I still don't undertand it yet. Too much geometery using sin and radians and what not. I can obviously manipulate it, but I'm just changing values.
